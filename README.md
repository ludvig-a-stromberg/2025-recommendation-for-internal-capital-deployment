# Case: 2025 Recommendation for Internal Capital Deployment
This is an independent case, set at the end of 2024, where we assume an advisory role inside/toward a theoretical risk control division at SEB and develop a recommendation for managing a portfolio of surplus capital over the 2025 operating year in order to meet certain objectives.

Although it is hopefully already apparent to the reader: this case is an entirely theoretical and independent analyst project that is not commisioned by or affiliated with SEB in any capacity.
